Definition:

A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.


Immutability:

Strings are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed directly. Instead, new strings are created.


Indexing:

Individual characters in a string can be accessed using indexing. For example, my_string[0] accesses the first character.


Built-in Methods:

Strings support various built-in methods:
len(): Returns the length of the string.
upper(): Converts all characters to uppercase.
lower(): Converts all characters to lowercase.
strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespaces.
replace(old, new): Replaces occurrences of 'old' with 'new'.


# Numberic Data Type

**1. Numeric Data Types in Python (int, float):**

- Python supports two primary numeric data types: `int` for integers and `float` for floating-point numbers.
- Integers are whole numbers, and floats can represent both whole and fractional numbers.
- You can perform arithmetic operations on these types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
- Be aware of potential issues with floating-point precision, which can lead to small inaccuracies in calculations.
- Python also provides built-in functions for mathematical operations, such as `abs()`, `round()`, and `math` module for advanced functions.
